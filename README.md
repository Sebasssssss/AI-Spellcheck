Sure, here's a README.md file for the AI-Spellcheck project:

# AI-Spellcheck

AI-Spellcheck is a web application that uses artificial intelligence to find and correct spelling mistakes in text. The application is built using the Cohere API, a powerful natural language processing tool that allows us to analyze text and suggest corrections.

The user interface for AI-Spellcheck is built using the Svelte framework, a lightweight and efficient front-end framework. The website is built using the Astro static site generator, which allows us to build a fast and responsive website.

## Getting Started

To get started with AI-Spellcheck, you'll need to have an API key from Cohere. You can sign up for a free account and get an API key at the [Cohere website](https://cohere.ai/).

Once you have your API key, you can clone the AI-Spellcheck repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/AI-Spellcheck.git
cd AI-Spellcheck
npm install
```

Then, head to the file 'is.js' and at the top of the file, modify the variable called 'COHERE_API_KEY' and write yours:

```
const COHERE_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
```

Finally, start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```
